## JSON Repors can be generated ###
CucumberResultsOverview results = new CucumberResultsOverview();
results.setOutputDirectory("Exercise1");
results.setOutputName("cucumber-results");
results.setSourceFile("desiredFileLocation");
results.execute();



## A Sample report would contain:
Number of Features Run = 1
Number of Scenarios Run= 5
Number of steps Run = 12
Duration of test = 1:52 sec
Number of steps passed = 7

Another way of pulling up a detailed report can be in the following format:
Describe the Feature , scenario and steps and show the passed steps in green
and the failed steps in red
